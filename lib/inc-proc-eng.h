/* The Incremental Processing Engine is a framework for incrementally
 * processing changes from different inputs. The main user is ovn-controller.
 * To compute desired states (e.g. openflow rules) based on many inputs (e.g.
 * south-bound DB tables, local OVSDB interfaces, etc.), it is straightforward
 * to recompute everything when there is any change in any inputs, but it
 * is inefficient when the size of the input data becomes large. Instead,
 * tracking the changes and update the desired states based on what's changed
 * is more efficient and scalable. However, it is not straightforward to
 * implement the change-based processing when there are a big number of
 * inputs. In addition, what makes it more complicated is that intermediate
 * results needs to be computed, which needs to be reused in different part
 * of the processing and finally generates the final desired states. It is
 * proved to be difficult and error-prone to implement this kind of complex
 * processing by ad-hoc implementation.
 *
 * This framework is to provide a generic way to solve the above problem.
 * It does not understand the processing logic, but provides a unified way
 * to describe the inputs and dependencies clearly, with interfaces for
 * users to implement the processing logic for how to handle each input
 * changes.
 *
 * The engine is composed of engine_nodes. Each engine_node is either
 * an input, an output or both (intermediate result). Each engine node
 * maintains its own data, which is persistent across interactions. Each node
 * has zero to ENGINE_MAX_INPUT inputs, which creates a DAG (directed
 * acyclic graph). For each input of each engine_node, there is a
 * change_handler to process changes of that input, and update the data
 * of the engine_node. Then the user can simply call the run() method
 * of the engine so that the processing will happen in the order according
 * to the dependencies defined and handle the changes incrementally.
 *
 * While the more fine-grained dependencies and change-handlers are
 * implemented, the more efficient the processing will be, it is not
 * realistic to implement all change-processing for all inputs (and
 * intermediate results). The engine doesn't require change-handler to be
 * implemented for every input of every node. Users can choose to implement
 * the most important change-handlers (for the changes happens most
 * frequently) for overall performance. When there is no change_handler
 * defined for a certain input on a certain engine_node, the run() method
 * of the engine_node will be called to fall-back to a full recompute
 * against all its inputs.
