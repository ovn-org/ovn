/* Overview
 * ========
 *
 * OVS tests directory contains many small test programs. One down side
 * of building them as individual programs is that they all have to be
 * linked whenever a library function is modified.
 *
 * ovstest is an attempt to improve the overall build time by linking
 * all test programs into a single program, ovs-test. Regardless of
 * the number of test programs, linking will be done only once to produce
 * ovstest.
 *
 * With ovstest, each test programs now becomes a sub program of ovstest.
 * For example, 'mytest' program, can now be invoked as 'ovstest mytest'.
 *
 * 'ovstest --help' will list all test programs can be invoked.
 *
 * The 'Usage' section below documents how to add a new sub program
 * to ovstest using OVSTEST_REIGSTER macros.
 */

typedef void (*ovstest_func)(int argc, char *argv[]);

void ovstest_register(const char *test_name, ovs_cmdl_handler f);

/* Usage
 * =====
 *
 * For each sub test program, its 'main' program should be named as
 * '<test_name>_main()'.
 *
 * The 'main' programs should be registered with ovstest as a sub program.
 *    OVSTEST_REGISTER(name, function)
 *
 * 'name' will be name of the test program. It is expected as argv[1] when
 * invoking with ovstest.
 *
 * 'function' is the 'main' program mentioned above.
 *
 * Example:
 * ----------
 *
 * Suppose the test program is called my-test.c
 * ...
 *
 * static void
 * my_test_main(int argc, char *argv[])
 * {
 *   ....
 * }
 *
 * OVSTEST_REGISTER("my-test", my_test_main);
