.SH NAME
\*(PN \- convert ``ovs\-appctl ofproto/trace'' output to combine
OVN logical flow information.
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB\*(PN < \fIfile\fR
.so lib/common-syn.man
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fB\*(PN\fR program reads \fBovs\-appctl ofproto/trace\fR output on
stdin, looking for flow cookies, and expand each cookie with corresponding OVN
logical flows. It expands logical flow further with the north-bound information
e.g. the ACL that generated the logical flow, when relevant.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.so lib/common.man
.
.IP "\fB\-\-ovnsb=\fIserver\fR"
The OVN Southbound DB remote to contact.  If the \fBOVN_SB_DB\fR
environment variable is set, its value is used as the default.
Otherwise, the default is \fBunix:@RUNDIR@/ovnsb_db.sock\fR, but this
default is unlikely to be useful outside of single-machine OVN test
environments.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-ovnnb=\fIserver\fR"
The OVN Northbound DB remote to contact.  If the \fBOVN_NB_DB\fR
environment variable is set, its value is used as the default.
Otherwise, the default is \fBunix:@RUNDIR@/ovnnb_db.sock\fR, but this
default is unlikely to be useful outside of single-machine OVN test
environments.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-ovs=\fR"
Also decode flow information (like OVS ofport) from the flows by connecting
to the OVS DB.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-ovsdb=\fIserver\fR"
The OVS DB remote to contact if \fB\-\-ovs\fR is present.  If the
\fBOVS_RUNDIR\fR environment variable is set, its value is used as the
default. Otherwise, the default is \fBunix:@RUNDIR@/db.sock\fR, but this
default is unlikely to be useful outside of single-machine OVN test
environments.
.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR \fIprivkey.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-private\-key=\fIprivkey.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing the private key used as \fB\*(PN\fR's
identity for outgoing SSL connections.
.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIcert.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-certificate=\fIcert.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing a certificate that certifies the
private key specified on \fB\-p\fR or \fB\-\-private\-key\fR to be
trustworthy.  The certificate must be signed by the certificate
authority (CA) that the peer in SSL connections will use to verify it.
.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR \fIcacert.pem\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-ca\-cert=\fIcacert.pem\fR"
Specifies a PEM file containing the CA certificate that \fB\*(PN\fR
should use to verify certificates presented to it by SSL peers.  (This
may be the same certificate that SSL peers use to verify the
certificate specified on \fB\-c\fR or \fB\-\-certificate\fR, or it may
be a different one, depending on the PKI design in use.)
