    This database is the interface between OVN Bridge Controller and the
    cloud management system (CMS) to program and control the OVS bridges
    using OVN logical flows. The CMS produces almost all of
    the contents of the database.  The <code>ovn-bridge-controller</code> program
    monitors the database contents and programs the OVS bridges with the
    OpenFlow rules.
